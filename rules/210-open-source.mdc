# Open Source Project Engineering Ruleset

**Goal:** Create welcoming, maintainable open source projects that encourage contributions and make it easy for others to use and contribute.

## Essential Files

### CONTRIBUTING.md

**MUST** include:

- How to set up development environment
- How to run tests
- Code style and formatting guidelines
- How to submit pull requests
- How to report bugs
- Code of conduct reference

**Template:**

```markdown
# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git`
3. Install dependencies: `make init`
4. Run tests: `make test`

## Making Changes

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `make test`
4. Run linter: `make lint`
5. Commit using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
6. Push and open a pull request

> [!NOTE]
> **Agents:** remote writes (push/PR creation) are default-deny and require explicit authorization (see `060-agent-audit.mdc`).

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style
- Run `make lint` before committing
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

## Reporting Bugs

Use GitHub Issues and include:
- Description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, version, etc.)

## Questions?

Open a GitHub Discussion or reach out to maintainers.
```

### README.md

**MUST** include:

### Release Process

1. Update version in code
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create git tag: `git tag v1.2.0`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.2.0`
5. Create GitHub release
6. Publish to package registry (if applicable)

## Security

### Security Policy

Create `SECURITY.md`:

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@acme.com
Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
```

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use Dependabot or similar
- Audit for vulnerabilities
- Pin versions in production

## Community Management

### Responding to Issues

- Acknowledge issues promptly (within 48 hours)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Label issues appropriately
- Close issues when resolved (with explanation)

### Reviewing Pull Requests

- Review within a week
- Provide constructive feedback
- Thank contributors
- Merge when ready

### Communication

- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Use inclusive language
- Assume good intent
- Be patient with newcomers

## Automation

### GitHub Actions

Automate common tasks:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Release automation
- Label management
- Stale issue/PR management

### Pre-commit Hooks

Enforce code quality:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```
