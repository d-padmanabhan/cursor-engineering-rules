# Local Overrides

This file is for **workspace-specific** rule customizations.

## Usage

Add project-specific rules here that override or extend the standard ruleset.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Project-Specific Rules

## Custom Patterns
- Use `internal/` package structure
- Prefer gRPC over REST for internal services
- Use specific logging format: [timestamp] [level] [component] message
```

## Notes

- This file is workspace-specific and should be in `.cursor/rules/999-local-overrides.mdc`
- Rules here take precedence over numbered rules (100-800)
- Keep overrides minimal - prefer updating central rules when possible
