#  Commit Message Standards

**Goal:** clean, conventional, descriptive commits that communicate intent and feed changelogs.

## Format

```

<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<bulleted list of key changes>

<optional explanatory paragraph>
```

* First line ≤ **72 chars**, imperative mood (“add”, “fix”, “update”).
* Bullets: start with a **capital letter**, **no period**.
* Add a short **rationale paragraph** when the change is non-obvious.
* Use issue refs when helpful (`Fixes #123`, `Refs #456`).

### Canonical Example

```
docs(upgrade): reorganize and enhance v3.4→v3.8 upgrade guide

- Prioritize ANF-disabled path (Path A)
- Add rationale for route table rotation logic
- Include Q-chat verification prompt
- Add ANF cost caution in Path B
- Remove duplicate ANF-disabled section
- Improve flow to reduce confusion

Improves upgrade experience by making common path primary and documenting motivation behind state changes.
```

## Commit Types (Conventional Commits)

| type         | purpose                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **feat**     | new feature or enhancement          |
| **fix**      | bug fix                             |
| **docs**     | documentation changes               |
| **refactor** | restructure without behavior change |
| **perf**     | performance improvement             |
| **test**     | add/update tests                    |
| **ci**       | GitHub Actions / build infra        |
| **chore**    | dependencies, cleanup               |
| **revert**   | revert a previous commit            |

> **BREAKING CHANGES** require:
> `feat(api)!: ...` + footer:
>
> ```
> BREAKING CHANGE: renamed output vpc_id to lattice_vpc_id
> ```

---

## Scopes (suggested)

Use a concise noun oriented around the domain:

Example scopes:
`terraform`, `aws`, `gha`, `cli`, `lattice`, `cloudflare`, `module/<name>`, `docs`, `security`

> If working from a Jira branch: use the ticket as the scope (`PROJ-1234`)

Examples:

```
feat(terraform): add vpc lattice service network module
fix(gha): correct permissions for PR comment
perf(python): cache IAM role lookups
```

#  Commit Approval & User Confirmation

**CRITICAL:** AI agents must **NEVER** commit code without explicit user approval.

**Remote writes (default-deny):** By default, do **not** `git push`, open PRs, or take any action that modifies remote state.
Only perform remote writes when the user explicitly authorizes the specific operation, and record the authorization + commands + results in the audit report (see `060-agent-audit.mdc`).

## Pre-Commit Workflow

Before executing any `git commit` command:

1. **Show the complete commit message** in a formatted preview:

```
==================== COMMIT MESSAGE PREVIEW ====================
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

- <change 1>
- <change 2>
- <change 3>

<optional explanatory paragraph>
================================================================
```

2. **Display files to be committed:**
```
Files to be committed:
  modified:   path/to/file1.py
  new file:   path/to/file2.md
  deleted:    path/to/file3.txt
```

3. **Ask for explicit confirmation:**
```
Should I proceed with this commit? (yes/no)
```

4. **Only execute** after receiving explicit user approval

## Example Interaction

```
I've prepared the following commit:

==================== COMMIT MESSAGE PREVIEW ====================
feat(communication): add 31 modern workplace phrases

- Add sync up, take it offline, level set phrases
- Add sanity check, gut check, smell test
- Add land the plane, spin up, heavy lift
- Add remote work terms (async, OOO, WFH)
- Add collaboration phrases (pick brain, have back)

Enhances workplace communication guide with commonly used
modern tech industry terminology.
================================================================

Files to be committed:
  modified:   100-ai/pdb/100a-communications-samples.md

Should I proceed with this commit? (yes/no)
```

**User must explicitly respond "yes" before commit executes.**

#  Branch & Merge Policy

## Branch Naming

```
<type>/<scope>-<short-topic>[-issue-<n>]
```

Examples:

```
feat/terraform-lattice-issue-421
fix/gha-permissions-pr-comment
docs/upgrade-guide-3-8
```

## History Hygiene

* Prefer small, logically cohesive commits
* Squash only noisy/WIP histories
* Rebase onto `main` before merge (unless policy forbids)
* Separate mechanical formatting from logical changes

---

#  Pull Request Standards

**PR Title** mirrors commit header:

```
<type>(<scope>): <concise summary>
```

**Body** must include:

* **What & Why**
* **Risk / Impact** (breaking changes, migrations)
* **Tests** (added/updated + any manual validation)
* **Screenshots or artifacts** where relevant (e.g., plan/apply output)
* **Linked Issues** (`Fixes #123`)

**Labels & Reviewers**: Ensure correct ownership and review coverage.

---

#  Sign-off & Security

* Signed commits if mandated by project
* DCO sign-off if required
* No secrets in commits, diffs, PRs, or screenshots
* Large binaries → artifacts, not git

---

#  Repository Scaffolding & Hygiene

Every repo **must** contain the following foundational files with project-appropriate content:

| File                               | Requirement                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gitignore`                       | Based on language/framework presets (GitHub templates)                |
| `.editorconfig`                    | Enforce consistent indentation, LF, charset                           |
| `.gitattributes`                   | Normalize line endings, set diff behavior for binaries                |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml`          | **Must include top-level `name:`** and proper language-specific hooks |
| `.markdownlint.yaml`               | Align with workspace Markdown rules                                   |
| `.commitlintrc.yaml`               | Enforce commit conventions                                            |
| `.dependabot.yaml`                 | Automated dependency update checks                                    |
| `CODEOWNERS`                       | Assign ownership to enforce review policy                             |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Enforce PR format above                                               |

> [!TIP]
> Add a periodic maintenance step like:
>
> ```
> pre-commit autoupdate
> ```
>
> to keep hooks updated.
