# Agent Workflow & Audit Requirements

These rules apply to **AI agents operating in this workspace**. They are designed to make work **reversible**, **verifiable**, and **auditable**.

---

## 1) Remote Writes: Default Deny, Explicitly Authorized Exceptions Only

By default, AI agents MUST NOT modify **any remote state**.

If (and only if) the user explicitly authorizes a specific remote write (**HITL / human-in-the-loop**), the agent may execute **only** the authorized command(s) and MUST record:
- the exact authorization (who/when/what),
- the exact commands executed,
- the results and exit codes,
in the audit report.

This includes (non-exhaustive):
- **Git remote**: `git push`, `git fetch` + forced updates, `git tag` pushes, changing remotes, or any operation that writes to `origin`/`upstream`.
- **GitHub remote**: creating/merging PRs, pushing branches, forking repos, editing issues/PRs via write APIs.
- **Cloud / infra / data planes**: `terraform apply`, `kubectl apply`, `helm upgrade`, `aws cloudformation deploy`, database migrations against non-local DBs, or any command that changes remote resources.

**Commits are local-only** and allowed **only after explicit user authorization** (see `110-git.mdc`).

---

## 2) Local Branch Discipline

All work MUST be performed on the **current branch**.

Requirements:
- Record the baseline branch name and `HEAD` SHA in the audit report
- Create a local backup branch before making changes:
  - `DTTM="$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"`
  - `git branch "checkout-point/${DTTM}" HEAD`
- Do not fast-forward, rebase, or otherwise rewrite shared history unless explicitly authorized

---

## 3) Backups & Checkpoints (Mandatory)

Before making changes, create **identifiable, reversible checkpoints** and record them in the audit report.

Minimum checkpoints:
- **Baseline identifier**: record `HEAD` SHA and current branch name.
- **Working tree backup**: create a stash that includes untracked files:
  - `git stash push -u -m "checkpoint/<id>"`
- **Rollback anchor**: create a local checkpoint reference:
  - `git branch "checkout-point/<id>" <baseline-sha>`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **User edits always take precedence.**
>
> AI agents MUST NOT discard or overwrite a user's manual working-tree changes unless the user explicitly asks.
> Treat these as destructive operations that require explicit user direction:
>
> - `git restore ...` (worktree discard)
> - `git checkout -- ...` (worktree discard)
> - `git reset --hard ...` (index + worktree discard)
> - `git clean -fd ...` (untracked deletion)
>
> If the agent needs to revert *its own* changes, it must propose the exact commands and file list first and wait for approval.

Checkpoint rules:
- Each checkpoint MUST have a unique `<id>` (recommend `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`).
- Every checkpoint MUST be recorded with a timestamp and identifier in the audit report.

---

## 4) Local Verification Gate (Mandatory)

Before proposing any commit messages (or asking to commit), run local verification **as applicable**:
- **Unit/integration tests**
- **Lint**
- **Formatting**
- **Type checks**
- **Build/package step**

“As applicable” means:
- If the repo/tooling supports it, run it.
- If it cannot be run (missing tool, missing dependency install, platform limitation, no config present), you MUST state:
  - the exact reason,
  - the closest substitute you ran instead (if any),
  - and what evidence you relied on.

Examples (not exhaustive):
- Python: `pytest`, `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`/`pyright`
- JS/TS: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `tsc --noEmit`
- General: `pre-commit run --all-files` (if configured)

---

## 5) Verifiable Audit Report (Tiered - mandatory for critical tasks)

Audit reports are useful, but writing a full command-by-command report for every task can slow down work.
Use the following tiers.

### Critical tasks (MANDATORY - full report)

Write/append a full report when the task has meaningful blast radius or risk, including:

- **History rewriting or force updates**: `git rebase`, `git filter-repo`, `git push --force-with-lease`
- **Remote state changes**: `terraform apply`, `kubectl apply` (non-local clusters), `helm upgrade`, CloudFormation deploys, DB migrations
- **Security / identity / access** changes: auth, IAM, KMS, OIDC, secrets handling
- **Destructive actions** (even if explicitly requested): `git restore` (discard), `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, mass deletes
- **Multi-repo** operations or broad refactors where rollback is non-trivial

### Routine tasks (OPTIONAL - lightweight entry)

For small, routine changes (especially docs-only), an audit report is optional.
If you want a record, append a lightweight entry:

- timestamps
- commit SHA + subject
- file list
- push command + result (if applicable)

### Trivial local-only tasks (NO report)

No report is needed for trivial local-only actions with no commit/push and no risk (for example: reading files, answering questions, exploring options).

### Repo root identifier (required)

Agents MUST resolve the absolute repository root path:

- `export GIT_REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`

### Path rules
- If `<GIT_REPO_ROOT>/extras/` exists **and** it is gitignored, write to:
  - `<GIT_REPO_ROOT>/extras/agent_reports/$(date +%F)-agent-report-<repo>-<branch>.md`
- Otherwise write to:
  - `/tmp/$(date +%F)-agent-report-<repo>-<branch>.md`

### Append vs create (required)

- If the report file already exists for the day, **append** a new session section (include start/end timestamps, commands, results, etc.)
- If it does not exist, **create** it and then append the session content

### Required contents (critical tasks)
The report MUST include:
- Start and end timestamps (**local time and UTC**)
- Repo name, branch name, `HEAD` SHA
- Every command executed (copy-pasteable) with **exit codes**
- Summary of changes:
  - `git status`
  - `git diff --stat`
  - list of changed files
- Verification outputs: test/lint/format/type-check/build summaries
- “Planned commits” section with proposed commit messages (even if no commit is made)
- Checkpoints/backups section with timestamps and identifiers
- Any explicitly authorized remote-write operations (if any) with timestamps, commands, and exit codes

### Optional: Terminal Recordings (asciinema)

For complex debugging sessions or demos, agents MAY create terminal recordings using `asciinema`.

**When to record:**
- Complex debugging where timing/flow matters
- Sessions that would benefit from visual playback
- When user explicitly requests a recording

**Recording path:**
- Save to: `<GIT_REPO_ROOT>/extras/agent_reports/recordings/$(date +%F)-agent-recording-<repo>-<branch>-$(date +%H%M%S).cast`
- Reference the recording path in the markdown audit report

**How to record:**
```bash
# Start recording
asciinema rec -q "<GIT_REPO_ROOT>/extras/agent_reports/recordings/session.cast"

# ... perform commands ...

# Stop recording (Ctrl+D or exit)
```

**Important:**
- Recordings are a **supplement**, not a replacement for markdown reports
- The markdown report remains the **primary audit artifact** (searchable, structured)
- Recordings are for **understanding flow**, not for audit compliance

---

## 6) If Commits Are Authorized Later

Only after the user explicitly authorizes commits:
- Commit **locally** with the agreed messages.
- Append to the audit report:
  - commit SHAs and commit messages
  - `git log --date=iso-strict -n <N>` output (where `<N>` covers the new commits)

---

## 7) GitHub CLI (gh) Read-Only Mode

Allowed:
- `gh repo view`
- `gh issue list` / `gh issue view`
- `gh pr list` / `gh pr view`
- `gh api` **GET requests only**

Disallowed (non-exhaustive):
- `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`
- `gh repo fork`
- any `gh api` mutation (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE)

---

## 8) Method to the Madness (Required Sequence)

Understand task -> propose plan -> create minimal change set -> take checkpoints ->
run verification -> produce audit report -> propose commit(s) -> wait for approval
