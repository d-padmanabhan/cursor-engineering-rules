# Git Fundamentals

## What is a Ref?

A **ref** (reference) is Git's way of creating human-readable names for commit hashes. Instead of remembering `a3f8b2c...`, you use names like `main` or `v1.2.3`.

Refs are bookmarks pointing to specific commits in your repository's history. They are stored as simple text files in `.git/refs/` containing a 40-character commit SHA.

## Types of Refs

| Ref Type | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Local branches | `refs/heads/main` | Track your local work |
| Remote-tracking branches | `refs/remotes/origin/main` | Your local copy of what the remote server has |
| Tags | `refs/tags/v1.2.3` | Permanent markers for releases |
| HEAD | `.git/HEAD` | Special pointer to wherever you are right now |

## The Three-Tier Model

Understanding the relationship between remote and local branches prevents confusion:

```
Remote branch (on server)     :  main
                                  ↓
Remote-tracking branch (local):  origin/main
                                  ↓
Local branch (your work)      :  main
```

**Key insight:** When you run `git fetch`, only the remote-tracking branch updates. Your local branch and working files remain untouched.

This is why you can safely inspect remote changes before integrating them:

```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/main          # See what's new on remote
git diff origin/main         # Compare with your local state
git merge origin/main        # Integrate when ready
```

## Fetch vs Pull

| Command | What It Does | Touches Working Tree? |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| `git fetch` | Downloads commits, updates remote-tracking refs | No |
| `git pull` | Fetch + merge (or rebase) into current branch | Yes |

**Why fetch is safer:** You can inspect what changed remotely before deciding to integrate. Fetch updates your "map" of the remote without changing your actual location or files.

## Always Prune Stale Refs

When branches are deleted on the remote, your local remote-tracking refs become stale "ghosts." Use `--prune` to clean them up:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
```

**Recommended:** Enable automatic pruning globally:

```bash
git config --global fetch.prune true
```

Now every `git fetch` and `git pull` automatically removes stale remote-tracking branches.

> [!NOTE]
> `--prune` only removes remote-tracking branches (like `origin/feat-old`). It does NOT delete your local branches. Your local work is always safe.

## Robust Feature Branch Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before creating any feature branch, fetch the remote and prove the selected base is current. Branch creation from a stale base is blocked. If the current worktree contains user changes, do not switch branches or stash those changes; create an isolated worktree from `origin/main`.

Required pre-branch proof:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
test "$(git rev-parse main)" = "$(git rev-parse origin/main)"
```

If the proof fails, update local `main` with the clean-worktree workflow below or branch directly from the refreshed `origin/main`.

When creating a feature branch from an updated `main`, use this explicit pattern:

```bash
# Step 1: Download latest from remote, clean up deleted branches
git fetch origin --prune

# Step 2: Move to main branch explicitly
git switch main

# Step 3: Fast-forward only (refuses to create merge commits)
git pull --ff-only

# Step 4: Create and switch to feature branch
git switch -c feat/your-feature-name
```

**Why this pattern?**

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `git fetch origin --prune` | Get latest state, clean stale refs |
| `git switch main` | Ensures you start from the right place |
| `git pull --ff-only` | Prevents accidental merge bubbles |
| `git switch -c` | Creates branch from now-updated main |

## Direct Remote-Base Alternatives

Skip your local `main` by branching directly from the refreshed `origin/main`.

### Clean Worktree

Use `git switch -c` only after proving the current worktree is clean:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
git switch -c feat/your-feature origin/main
```

**Advantages:**

- Faster (one fewer step)
- Works even if your local `main` is in a weird state
- Guaranteed to start from remote's latest

**Use when:** Local `main` is stale and the current worktree is verified clean.

### Dirty Worktree - Isolated Worktree Required

Create a new sibling worktree so user changes remain untouched:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git worktree add -b feat/your-feature "../repo-feature" origin/main
```

Choose a sibling path that does not already exist and perform all feature work there.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `git switch -c` is prohibited for this path because Git can carry compatible uncommitted changes onto the new branch. The mandatory preservation gate is in the Git rule (`${HANDBOOK_ROOT}/rules/130-git.mdc#preserve-user-work`).

## Inspect remote state, then push

Fetch and inspect the current branch before pushing to an existing remote branch. Do not blindly run `git pull --rebase`; it modifies local history and may be unsafe with a dirty tree, shared commits, or merge-based repository policy. The mandatory push gate is in 130-git.mdc (`${HANDBOOK_ROOT}/rules/130-git.mdc#branches-history-and-remote-writes`).

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --left-right --boundary HEAD...@{upstream}
```

Push when the branch is ahead only. If it is behind or diverged, integrate according to repository policy; rebase only when the worktree is clean and rewriting local commits is safe. Never force-push merely to bypass divergence.

For a brand-new branch with no upstream, use `git push -u origin HEAD`.
