# Agent Skills Evaluations

This directory contains the vendor-neutral evaluation harness for the handbook's Agent Skills. It validates every skill and compares selected tasks with and without a skill through an external agent adapter.

The eval files follow the portable Agent Skills conventions documented by [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills): each evaluated skill owns an `evals/evals.json` file with prompts, expected behavior, and optional fixtures. The local `checks` field is a documented extension for deterministic scoring.

## What the Harness Measures

- Skill metadata and directory-name correctness
- Eval schema and fixture integrity
- Deterministic output and artifact requirements
- With-skill pass rate versus the same baseline cases without the skill
- Paired win rate, median/p95 duration, and optional adapter-reported token/cost usage
- Observed skill activation when an agent runtime emits a `skill_loaded` event

The harness does not treat answer similarity, self-report, or reading `SKILL.md` as proof that a skill loaded. Automatic activation is runtime-specific and requires an authoritative runtime event. Cursor's current SDK does not expose that event, so Cursor benchmarks report `activation_telemetry_supported: false` and `activation_rate: null` while still measuring behavioral lift.

## Pilot Skills

- [Core engineering](../skills/core-engineering/evals/evals.json)
- [Cloudflare WAF author](../skills/cloudflare-waf-author/evals/evals.json)
- [IAM security advisor](../skills/iam-security-advisor/evals/evals.json)

The fixtures contain only synthetic, public-safe examples. Do not add customer data, production configuration, credentials, private incident details, or proprietary source code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python and development-tool management
- No package dependencies for deterministic validation
- The optional `eval` dependency group for Cursor SDK model-backed runs
- An executable adapter only for model-backed runs

## Validate Skills and Evals

Run the dependency-free checks used in pull-request CI:

```bash
uv run python -m evals.skill_eval validate
uv run python -m unittest discover -s evals/tests -v
```

Validation covers all immediate directories under [`skills/`](../skills/), including skills that do not yet have an eval suite.

## Eval File Contract

Each evaluated skill contains:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
└── evals/
    ├── evals.json
    └── fixtures/
```

The JSON shape is:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "sample-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "Perform the task.",
      "expected_output": "Describe the required behavior.",
      "assertions": ["The response performs the required behavior."],
      "files": ["evals/fixtures/input.txt"],
      "checks": [
        {
          "id": "required-behavior",
          "type": "contains",
          "value": "required phrase"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Fixture paths are relative to the skill root, matching the published convention. Standard `assertions` are preserved as human or judge rubrics. The local `checks` extension is optional and supports:

- `contains`: output contains one value
- `contains_all`: output contains every listed value
- `contains_any`: output contains at least one listed value
- `not_contains`: output excludes one value
- `regex`: output matches a Python regular expression
- `not_regex`: output does not match a Python regular expression
- `file_exists`: the adapter created a workspace-relative file
- `loaded_skill`: adapter events prove that a named skill loaded

Checks are case-insensitive by default. Set `"case_sensitive": true` when exact casing is behaviorally important. Set `"required": false` for diagnostic checks that should not fail a run.

Deterministic phrase checks are intentionally narrow. Use multiple behavioral cases instead of encoding prose style. `expected_output` and `assertions` remain grader-side rubrics and are never sent to the execution adapter.

Portable assertion-only suites pass schema validation, but this harness will not execute them without deterministic `checks`. Assertions need a future judge adapter; treating an ungraded assertion as passed would produce misleading results.

## Adapter Protocol

The runner invokes an executable directly with `shell=False`. The executable reads one request object from standard input and writes one response object to standard output. Diagnostics belong on standard error.

Request:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "mode": "with_skill",
  "skill": {
    "name": "sample-skill",
    "path": "/temporary/workspace/skills/sample-skill"
  },
  "prompt": "Perform the task.",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "inputs/evals/fixtures/input.txt",
      "sha256": "..."
    }
  ],
  "workspace": "/temporary/workspace"
}
```

For `without_skill`, `skill` is `null`. Both modes receive fresh workspaces containing byte-identical fixtures. The adapter must not reuse conversation state between requests.

Response:

```json
{
  "output": "Final agent response",
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "skill_loaded",
      "name": "sample-skill"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 1200,
    "output_tokens": 350,
    "cost_usd": 0.01
  }
}
```

Only `output` is required. `events` and `usage` may be empty. Usage values must be numeric. Events accept only `type` and optional `name`. Unknown response or event fields are rejected so adapters cannot accidentally persist hidden traces or undocumented data.

Adapters that cannot observe activation may emit `{"type":"activation_telemetry_unavailable","name":"<runtime>"}` for diagnostic clarity. This event does not satisfy `loaded_skill` and does not produce an activation rate.

An adapter is responsible for:

1. Starting a clean agent session.
2. Exposing the temporary workspace to the agent.
3. Installing or explicitly loading the supplied skill only in `with_skill` mode.
4. Capturing the final output and real activation events.
5. Returning no credentials, hidden prompts, or private chain-of-thought.

Do not implement adapters by concatenating untrusted input into a shell command. Pass arguments as an array and keep shell interpretation disabled.

## Run Model-Backed Comparisons

```bash
uv run python -m evals.skill_eval run \
  --adapter /absolute/path/to/agent-adapter \
  --skill core-engineering \
  --skill iam-security-advisor \
  --iterations 1 \
  --timeout-seconds 120 \
  --minimum-lift 0.1
```

Adapter arguments can be passed without a shell:

```bash
uv run python -m evals.skill_eval run \
  --adapter /usr/bin/python3 \
  --adapter-arg /absolute/path/to/adapter.py \
  --skill cloudflare-waf-author
```

### Cursor SDK adapter

The repository adapter uses a fresh local agent, project-only settings, and the read-only `read`, `grep`, `glob`, and `ls` tool allowlist. It stages the with-skill copy under `.cursor/skills/<name>` and leaves the baseline workspace without that skill.

```bash
export CURSOR_API_KEY="set-outside-shell-history"
export CURSOR_EVAL_MODEL="a-model-id-returned-for-your-account"

uv run --group eval python -m evals.skill_eval run \
  --adapter /usr/bin/env \
  --adapter-arg python3 \
  --adapter-arg "$PWD/evals/adapters/cursor_sdk_adapter.py" \
  --skill core-engineering \
  --iterations 1
```

Use at least three iterations before treating lift as stable. The adapter reports token usage and settled billed cost when available. It deliberately emits no `skill_loaded` event because the Cursor SDK does not provide authoritative automatic skill or rule activation telemetry.

The command exits:

- `0` when every required with-skill check passes and any configured minimum lift is met
- `1` when a with-skill behavior check fails
- `2` for invalid configuration, adapter errors, or timeouts

A positive lift is useful evidence, but it is not sufficient by itself. Without `--minimum-lift`, required with-skill behavior is the exit-code gate and zero or negative lift produces a warning. Review failed checks, outputs, and artifacts before changing a skill.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are written under the ignored path `tmp/skills-eval/<run-id>/`:

```text
tmp/skills-eval/<run-id>/<skill>/
├── benchmark.json
└── iteration-1/
    └── eval-1/
        ├── case.json
        ├── with_skill/
        │   ├── grading.json
        │   ├── output.txt
        │   ├── response.json
        │   └── timing.json
        └── without_skill/
            └── ...
```

Common bearer tokens, secret assignments, sensitive dictionary keys, and private-key blocks are redacted before persistence. Redaction is defense in depth, not permission to use sensitive inputs. Keep artifacts local or upload them with restricted access and short retention.

## Cost and Safety Limits

The defaults are:

- one iteration
- 120-second timeout per adapter call
- 1 MiB enforced limit for standard output and standard error each, captured in temporary files rather than process memory
- sequential execution
- no paid or credentialed model runs in pull-request CI

Use at least three iterations before treating a variable model result as a regression. Agent adapters should additionally enforce token, tool-call, concurrency, and suite-cost budgets supported by their runtime.

External side effects are outside eval scope. Adapters must use isolated fixtures and read-only or mocked tools. Never point a skill eval at production cloud accounts, databases, Git remotes, or customer systems.

## Adding Another Skill

1. Identify behavior the skill should improve over the baseline.
2. Add positive, near-miss, and safe-stop cases.
3. Prefer deterministic assertions for security boundaries, required artifacts, and prohibited behavior.
4. Keep fixtures synthetic and identical across modes.
5. Run validation and at least one model-backed comparison.
6. Review pass-rate lift, output quality, token use, and latency.
7. Add runtime-specific trigger cases only when the adapter can report actual skill loads.

Expand beyond the pilots after the harness produces stable, actionable findings without excessive false failures.
